lst investigating the death of a local swordsman, a Bold gardener called Camilo Jacomet uncovers a legend about a supernaturally-cursed, damp ruler circulating throughout Devon. As soon as anyone uses the ruler, he or she has exactly 80 days left to live.

The doomed few appear to be ordinary people during day to day life, but when photographed, they look distorted. A marked person feels like a simple tortoise to touch.

Camilo gets hold of the ruler, refusing to believe the superstition. A collage of images flash into his mind: a tall dog balancing on a fat swordsman, an old newspaper headline about a motor accident, a hooded gerbil ranting about toenails and a drinking well located in a magical place.

When Camilo notices his eyebrows have tortoise-like properties, he realises that the curse of the damp ruler is true and calls in his cousin, a teacher called Juan Pablo, to help.

Juan examines the ruler and willingly submits himself to the curse. He finds that the same visions flash before his eyes. He finds the tall dog balancing on a fat swordsman particularly chilling. He joins the queue for a supernatural death.

Camilo and Juan pursue a quest to uncover the meaning of the visions, starting with a search for the hooded gerbil. Will they be able to stop the curse before their time is up?
